This file contains details on the MR_predictor input files used to generate the simulations which appear in this report. MR_predictor requires 6 input files to run, shown below.  For more information on the MR_predictor input types, see http://coruscant.itmat.upenn.edu/mr_predictor/example-input-files/

----------------------

infosheet: Contains rsids, effect and reference allele, and effect allele frequency for SNPs to be simulated

	infosheet - rsids, alleles, and frequencies for 13 SNPs exclusively associated with SBP from the conservative instrument

phenophile: Contains types and prevalences of traits to be simulated.  The T2D prevalences in the files below are adjusted so that the actual T2D prevalence in output simulations is approximately 9.8%, the rate measured by Cowie et al, 2006.
	
	phenofileA - T2D rate appropriate for simulations in which both BMI and SBP affect T2D risk
	phenofileB - T2D rate appropriate for simulations under the null model where BMI increases T2D risk, but SBP does not

iifile: contains information on how intermediate traits interact with each other

	iifile - BMI/SBP interaction drawn from higher estimate from Dudina et al 2011

idfile: Contains information on how intermediate traits interact with outcome (in SD units).  BMI/T2D effect estimate in both files is drawn from Sheikh et al, 2014

	idfileA - SBP increases T2D by approximately 2% for each mmHg (in units of SD for SBP: 17.89mmHg in accordance with results from Ehret et al, 2010)
	idfileB - Null model in which SBP does not increase T2D risk.

scorefile: Contains genetic associations with intermediate traits

    scorefile - SBP associations between each of 13 SNP in conservative instrument (SD units)

ldinfosheet: Contains ld info for SNPs to be simulated

	ldinfosheet - Since all SNPs in the conservative instrument have been filtered for ld, this file is purposefully blank.
