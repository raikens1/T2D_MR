This folder includes:
 - README.txt
 - Egger_Regression_analysis_and_plots.Rmd and .html
 - Egger_Regression_simulation_for_bias.Rmd and .html

Egger_Regression_analysis_and_plots.Rmd: 
	contains rationale and code for running IVW and Egger Regression, generating regression and funnel plots, and estimating SE empirically through bootstrapping. The .html file is the compiled document for viewing. 

Egger_Regression_simulation_and_bias.Rmd: 
	contains rationale and code for a function which generates MR association data with set levels of noise and bias, then collects results from Egger Regression.  Also includes a sample simulation analysis as described in the body of the report.
