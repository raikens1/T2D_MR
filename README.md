This directory contains supplementary code for our Mendelian Randomization analysis of systolic blood pressure and diabetes.

Egger_Regression directory contains R Markdown files and compiled html results illustrating Egger Regression plotting and simulation.

MR_Predictor_simulation directory contains python code and input files used to run GWAS simulations to check for bias due to correction for adiposity and exclusion of diabetics in ascertaining SBP association for the SNPs used in our genetic instrument.

Both directories have their own explainatory README.
